        As the name suggests, the bubble refers to speculative investments in internet companies. Because of the
        widespread success of the internet, there was an intense magnification of onlookers, particularly investors,
        who became interested in its success. Not necessarily the internet itself, but they were looking at the
        infrastructure in terms of it being able to make money for themselves. This bubble started around 1997 and
        peaked in 200 and adversely ended or “burst” around 2002. These investors were so enthusiastic about the
        newly evolving role of tech companies as they were pioneers of the industry, that they blindly threw money
        at anything with a pulse. They stopped giving mind to whether or not a company was currently profitable or
        at the very least if they could even begin to become profitable. With common sense now thrown out the door,
        from 1997-2000 prices went up around 5 times and from 2000-2002 dropped the same amount. At the end of this
        bubble, 1 out of 2 internet companies survived companies such as pets.com having a market cap of 300 million
        dollars and decreasing drastically to 0 in the span of 268 days. However there were some successful
        businesses at the end of the bubble burst, starting at 100 dollars a share, then dropping to 7$ after the
        burst and climbing back up to 600$ per share.

        Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon saw a very systematic thinker, saw an appeal for the kinds of things that
        would fly off the shelves if sold on the internet. At the top of the lists of items that he made, books
        always fell atop the lists. Claiming that there was no way a bookstore could possibly have the millions of
        titles unless it was hosted remotely. There was astounding success at the startups of Amazon as well as
        Ebay and they would put up incredible numbers quarter after quarter. This caught the attention of those on
        Wall Street. After the invention of radio took 38 years for 50 million to use it, whereas it took 4 years
        to obtain 50 million users on the internet. The silicon chip was governed by what is called Moors law in
        which the speed and power of integrated circuits doubles every 18 months. With all of this in mind, it was
        possible for investors to place money into what seemed like a forever increasing business which perhaps
        resulted in the burst of the bubble.
