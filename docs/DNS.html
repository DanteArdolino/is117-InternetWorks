        Imagining a world in which one was unable to endlessly stream information at the tips of the finger is
        rather hard as we are blessed with such easily extracted information. Without the internet, people would
        be subjected to less information. No more being able to scout your blind dates on social media, or if
        one were feeling unwell, being unable to do a quick search and figure out whether or not it is as simple
        as taking an aspirin or something life-threatening that needs emergency assistance with a call to 911.
        Prior to google there was almost no search function. So with the world wide web having come to fruition,
        what was the use of such a seemingly useless function. Those who tried to create a search such as Yahoo,
        in the end they were unable to become the powerhouse that is Google.
      <p>
      </p>
      Today people take for granted the ease of the search bar, as there are millions of sites . Back when
      there was only page after page of plain text with lists of underlined sentences. Searching for things
      was close to impossible and users were subjected to using links and hoping that they stumbled upon
      whatever they were interested in. It seems as though the people who bring into existence the very
      basics of the internet are the ones who are slackers. Such is the cas with the developers of Yahoo,
      when their professor took a year long sabbatical, they stumbled across what is known today as Yahoo.
      <p>
      </p>
      Jerry Yang and David Fowler wanted to win a basketball game so they hunted around for sports data on
      the laborious web which became grounds for their passion. To work the internet, they needed a directory
      or guide as to how to peruse the information hosted on the web, back then it was very crude. Jerry and
      Davidâ€™s guide to the world wide web gained traction immediately overnight as this was a very essential
      need within the mysterious web industry. A VC Firm Moritz had backed Yahoo with by investing in them,
      although they had made no money off of it. No one at the time had figured out how to make revenue and
      profits through the internet. At the dawn of the web, it was not used for commerce and was considered an
      evil idea and implication.
      <p>
      </p>
      Advertisements. At first the Yahoo founders were hesitant to implement advertisements because they felt
      as though their users would rebel against such a thing. However, it was the best idea at the time
      because they were in need of money, so they decided to go through with it. In 1995 Yahoo bagan to take
      banner ads, and to their surprise, users were not ceasing use of Yahoo because of it. Rather, more users
      popped up over the world even though they had implemented ads. Eventually they had competitors and
      needed another interesting aspect other than what they originally intended to be, a search engine.
      Other search engines companies also stopped their focus from their original intent.
      <p>
      </p>
      This promoted the downfall of Yahoo because quite frankly they were not optimizing their search engine,
      but focusing on how they could be successful with things such as Yahoo mail. Other companies met his
      fate as well as they lost sight of where they had started from, perhaps due to the competition of other
      companies. Two other young geeks, Larry Page and Sergey Brin created what we all know today as Google.
      Page believed that a link from one website to another was a form of recommendation, and so they built
      upon this idea which heavily resulted in their success. With other ideals like the former, soon they
      would dominant the search engine industry with their forwardly thought out ideas.
