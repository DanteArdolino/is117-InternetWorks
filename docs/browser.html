      <p>
        In terms of technology that has proven to be groundbreaking amongst human civilization, there in recent
        years has been an invention that seemed to have come out of nowhere. When thinking of the pantheon of
        intuitive technology that changed the way humans function daily, the world wide web was not always the
        most regarded. Inventions such as the aeroplane, light bulb, steam engine were once heavily dominated
        when mentioning new technologies. The age of the internet began with a huge clash for power with the
        purpose of determining who would control the future of the newly forming web, ending in a courtroom
        battle and becoming known as the age of the browser war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by a Mister Tim Berners-Lee, an English scientist. At the time
        the web was very much unlike how it is today and was very barebones, no where close to being a
        mouse-click away from millions of people, music, and information. There was however line after line
        after line of text, and you had to be “geeky” to be enthusiastic about such a thing as mentioned in the
        video.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of these so called “geeks” was a student from the University of Illinois, Marc Andreesen who had the
        idea that “regular” people would soon use the internet as we do today, on such a normal scale it is now
        engraved in our daily lives. Anderson with this dream in mind set out to make the web more user
        friendly, adding media such as pictures and audio and their most important work, the point and click
        capabilities that are present in today's graphical web design. They went to work to make a mosaic but
        before this mosaic could be mass produced, they were in desperate need of cash flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim Clark, a self made man who studied computer science was intrigued by this mosaic, so he contacted
        Marc and gave him a job in Silicon Valley for one of his Clarks companies. Bill Gates who is the CEO and
        founder of the monopoly over PC operating systems and with such a tight grip on the computer industry.
        By 1993 about 90 percent of the world's PCs were running Microsoft, this brought competitors to their
        knees including the likes of IBM. Under the likes of Jim Clark, pioneers of the industry would soon
        launch the fastest growing software company the world had ever seen, Netscape Communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the lightning quick emergence of this company, it caught the attention of other powerhouses
        such as the overwhelming force of Microsoft. Immediately the thought process was how can we work with
        Netscape in order to bolster the company further, such as “How can Microsoft Word work with Netscape.”
        This soon took a turn for the worst with Microsoft attempting to buy out Netscape for 1 million dollars
        and any refusal of such would result in the copying of Netscape's features. This sparked a lawsuit
        against Microsoft and Netscape would want to go public as this was only their first year and they had
        no money. With the launch of IPO, Netscape's stock went off the charts which then ignited the boom that
        would soon rage for a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft went on to indulge in their own version of browser as they wanted a piece of the action as
        well. Internet explorer as we know is a powerhouse, and Clark finally felt the pressure of Microsoft
        breathing down its neck. Microsoft had astonishingly more money than Netscape and therefore could allow
        free use of the browser which marked the downfall of Netscape by 1997.
