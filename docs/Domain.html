        Prior to the invention of the internet, humans were reluctant to pass information to one another in a
        seemingly efficient fashion. The invention of the internet made it possible for human culture as well as
        civilization to prosper in a short period of time which had never been seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as it is human nature, the internet was used to strengthen the individual who seeked to use its
        content for their own needs. The internet can solidly be defined as introduced into society with the
        invention of Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite. The purpose of this satellite was to repurpose the
        meaning of science and technology as well as increase Russian dominance over the world and particularly
        the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fully encompass the invention of the internet JCR Licklider needs to be brought into the explanation.
        Licklider, a psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggested the idea that
        computers were capable of communication. In particular, they were able to do so and researchers could
        use this technology to their advantage in order to exchange information relatively faster than prior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another prominent figure in the revolution that was the beginnings of the internet, was Leonard
        Kleinrock. Kleinrock studied, like formerly mentioned Licklider, at MIT, and was doing research for
        a PhD in which he configured 2 central ideas in regard to communications networking. In order to
        optimize a network in the means of sharing information, the node should not get what it needs until it
        needs it. Next, he states that all nodes should have a control function rather than leaving one node to
        deal with such. This then introduced his idea of “packet switching” in which communication starts at one
        node and then passes through several intermediary nodes until it reaches the end node. Which is in
        contrast to the previous form being circuit switching.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1972, Ray Tomlinson had developed as referred to by the video the first “killer app” and this
        invention was the e-mail although at the time not the name, and developed the “@” sign in the process.
        Part of the reason for much of the success of the internet and the overwhelming speed at which it had
        developed is due to there being no authoritative guidance over its concepts. This was dubbed as the
        “generality of purpose” because ideas about how the internet should be regarded was made as a general
        consensus with whatever matter at hand being the purpose.
